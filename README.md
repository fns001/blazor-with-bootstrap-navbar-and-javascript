# Blazor, Bootstrap and JavaScript together

This minimalist Blazor WebAssembly app demonstrates how these technologies can work seamlessly together.

- The Navbar uses Boostrap 4.
- The table is populated with WebAssembly.
- Scrolling the page down gives the top navbar a box shadow: That is written in JavaScript.

## To run
- Clone the solution
- In Visual Studio set the server project as the startup project and press F5.
